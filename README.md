# My Cypress Automation

This project uses Cypress to automate key e-commerce test cases, including a successful registration and login feature, a test case that ensures the product search bar is working properly, and a complete scenario in which the customer can view products in the catalog, add or remove products from the cart, change information such as size, quantity, and color of clothing, watches, bags, etc., and then complete the purchase by entering their personal information and payment details. Upon completion, the customer will receive information about the successful order.

Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that allows developers to write tests and run them in a real browser.
